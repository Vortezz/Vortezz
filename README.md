### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Victor

I'm a French ðŸ¥– full-stack developer. I love creating web apps, Minecraft plugins, and mobile apps. I'm also an open-source enthusiast, and my goal is to provide ethical code ðŸŒ±.  
I enjoy learning new things and speaking English!

I'm currently in an MPI* preparatory class for engineering schools at Louis-Le-Grand in Paris.  
Since 2022, I've also been the Java Lead at [@Ekalia](https://ekalia.fr/).
